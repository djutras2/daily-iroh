Should I go put on a pot of tea for him?\nZuko: First, I have to get it out of here.\nIroh: And then what? You never think these things through. This is exactly what happened when you captured the Avatar at the North Pole. You had him and then you had no where to go!\nZuko: I would have figured something out.\nIroh: No, if his friends hadn't found you, you would have frozen to death!\nZuko: I know my own destiny, Uncle. \nIroh: Is it your *own* destiny, or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you?\nZuko: Stop it, Uncle.

            "Iroh: So this is how the great Commander Zhao acts in defeat? Disgraceful. Even in exile, my nephew is more honorable than you. Thanks again for the tea. It was delicious.\n[Iroh and Zuko leave]\nZuko: Did you really mean that, Uncle?\nIroh: Of course. I told you Ginseng tea is my favorite.",

            "Zhao: That's quite a bit of damage.\nZuko: Yes. You wouldn't believe what happened. Uncle, tell Commander Zhao what happened.\nIroh: Yes. I will do that. It was incredible.\nIroh: [to Zuko] What? Did we crash or something?",
