<h3>Hoo Boy</h3>
This is an android app I threw together embarssingly late into my college career. I obviously didn't know what I was doing... but this bad boy still sent $3.50 to my bank account every month for like 5 years.

I'm uploading so that Joshua, who reached out to me over email months ago, can give it a look see.

> Hey Dustin, thanks for your work on the Daily Iroh app on Google Play. I see it hasn't been updated to work with any recent android devices. Were you planning on updating this app? If not, would you be open to releasing the code to me so I may carry the torch? I would appreciate your reply! 

Best of luck Joshua. I'm so sorry about "Quotes.java". That is super cursed. If you find any personal information, please let me know. I haven't really given it a look. I assume any billing related stuff is obsolete by now. Do not rob me, please.

<b>Cheers!</b>
